# Understanding NBA Player Success: The Role of Physique, College, and Draft Background

Write a 1-2 sentences that quickly and clearly convey what your repo is for.

## Overview

This project explores how various physical and background attributes influence NBA player performance. Using data from the 2022–2023 NBA season, we investigate trends in player metrics such as points per game, rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages, and relate them to factors including height, weight, college, country of origin, and draft year. The goal is to uncover which traits—both physical and developmental—are most associated with success in professional basketball. Two research questions guide the analysis: one focused on physical metrics (e.g., height/weight) and the other on developmental factors (e.g., college, country, and draft background).

### Interesting Insight

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Repo Structure
This repository is organized into the following sections:

raw_data/: [Insert brief description here — e.g., raw CSV files downloaded from NBA.com or Kaggle]

code/: [Insert brief description here — e.g., R scripts used for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data]

KartikDev branch: Contains the EDA and analysis related to Research Question 1, which focuses on physical traits such as height and weight in relation to performance.

AdityaDev branch: Contains the EDA and analysis for Research Question 2, which examines non-physical factors such as college attended, country of origin, and draft year.

outputs/: [Insert brief description here — e.g., charts, summary tables, or model results generated during the analysis]

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

NBA.com: Player performance statistics were sourced via the NBA’s public API.

Kaggle.com: Supplemental player background information was obtained from publicly available datasets.

We would like to acknowledge the developers behind the nba_api Python package, which was instrumental in extracting reliable and up-to-date NBA performance data. We also recognize the contributions of open-source tools and documentation that supported our EDA and visualizations.
