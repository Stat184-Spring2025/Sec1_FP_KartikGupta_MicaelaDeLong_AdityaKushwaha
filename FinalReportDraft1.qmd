## Introduction 

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## FAIR Principles 

1. Findable 
- Metadata & Documentation: Ensure datasets are properly documented with clear descriptions ("NBA Player Statistics 2023" and "NBA Player Bios 2022-23").  
- Constant Identifiers: Use stable URLs ( Kaggle dataset DOI or NBA.com’s official stats page).  
- Searchable Keywords: Tag datasets with relevant terms ( "NBA," "basketball analytics," "player performance").  
2. Accessible 
- Open Access: The Kaggle dataset is publicly available, while NBA.com’s data may have usage restrictions (check terms of service).  
- Authentication if Needed: If NBA.com requires API keys, document access procedures.  
3. Interoperable  
- Standardized Formats: Use CSV/JSON for compatibility.  
- Common Variables: Merge datasets using player IDs/names for cross-analysis (e.g., linking stats to bios).  
- Clear Units: Define metrics (height in cm/ft, 3P% as a decimal).  
4. Reusable
- Licensing: Kaggle datasets often have CC licenses; NBA.com data may require attribution.  
- Methodology Transparency: Document how performance metrics ("best players") are calculated.  



## CARE Principles 

1. Collective Benefit  
- Community Insights: Share findings to benefit teams, players, and fans ( how draft position correlates with success).  
- Avoid Harm: Ensure analysis doesn’t reinforce biases (stereotyping players by physical attributes).  
2. Authority to Control
- Player Consent: Acknowledge that player data is public but avoid misuse (invasive predictions about health).  
- Respect NBA Policies: Follow league guidelines on data usage.  
3. Responsibility
- Bias Mitigation: Check if conclusions favor certain demographics (does "best schools" overlook international players?).  
- Transparency: Disclose limitations (stats don’t capture leadership intangibles).  
4. Ethics
- Privacy: Anonymization isn’t needed for public stats, but avoid combining data to infer private details.  
- Fair Representation: Ensure diverse player backgrounds (country, college) are analyzed equitably.

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
